This project for the Sri Lankan Robotics Challenge 2025 consists of six key tasks.

They get the motivation from the process of establishing the human settlement on Mars. For that, they have to build a greenhouse capable of producing food for the next wave of settlers.

TTask 1: Plantation Task

The first challenge takes place in the greenhouse, where a 6x4 grid marks
the potato plantation. The grid, delineated by white lines 3cm wide, represents the pathways for navigation. Each square cell measures 30 x 30 cm.

The robot begins in the first cell of the grid, with the first row and first column free of obstacles to facilitate initial navigation. Five plants are located within the grid, one plant per column of the rest of the grid. Plants will be located at the center of the respective cell. A cell with a plant is marked with green color sticker strip with a width of 3 cm.

Each plant is represented by a green cylinder, 5 cm in height and diameter, with a cavity at the top holding a standard ping pong ball. The balls symbolize potatoes, with yellow balls representing good potatoes and white balls representing bad potatoes. The robot must navigate the grid, collect all the potatoes, and exit the plantation, marking the completion of the first task.
